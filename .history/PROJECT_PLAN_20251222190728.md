# Note App - Project Plan

## Overview
A web-based note-taking application similar to Evernote that works on iPhone and can be saved to the home screen as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Core Requirements
✅ Works on iPhone (mobile-first design)
✅ Can be saved to home screen (PWA - Progressive Web App)
✅ Rich text editing (bold, italic, underline)
✅ Add pictures from phone
✅ Cloud backup/sync
✅ Dark mode (based on your screenshots)
✅ Free to use (no app store fees)

## Technology Stack Options

### Option 1: Modern Web Stack (Recommended)
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework) - great for PWAs
- **Backend**: Supabase (free tier) or Firebase (free tier)
  - Handles: user authentication, database, file storage
- **Rich Text Editor**: TipTap or Slate.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for modern, responsive design)
- **PWA**: Built into Next.js

**Pros**: Modern, scalable, free backend options
**Cons**: Requires some setup

### Option 2: Simpler Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Backend**: Firebase (simpler setup)
- **Rich Text Editor**: React Quill
- **Styling**: CSS or Tailwind

**Pros**: Simpler, faster to get started
**Cons**: Less optimized for production

### Option 3: Full-Stack Framework
- **Framework**: Next.js with API routes
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (free tier)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (for images)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth

**Pros**: All-in-one, very modern
**Cons**: More complex initially

## Recommended: Option 1 (Next.js + Supabase)

### Why?
- ✅ Free tier is generous (500MB database, 1GB storage)
- ✅ Easy authentication
- ✅ Real-time sync possible
- ✅ Great mobile support
- ✅ PWA support built-in

6. Mobile-responsive design

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
1. Image upload from phone
2. Cloud sync
3. PWA setup (installable on iPhone)
4. Search notes
5. Tags/categories

### Phase 3: Polish

```

## Setup Steps
1. Initialize Next.js project
2. Set up Supabase account and project
3. Configure authentication
4. Set up database schema (notes table)
5. Create basic UI components
6. Implement rich text editor
7. Add image upload functionality
8. Configure PWA manifest
9. Deploy to Vercel (free) or Netlify (free)

## Questions for You:
1. **Backend choice**: Do you want to use Supabase (free, easy) or would you prefer another option?
2. **Deployment**: Where should we host it? (Vercel is free and works great with Next.js)
3. **Features priority**: Which features are most important to you first?
4. **Design**: Should we match the dark theme from your screenshots exactly?

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 days of development
- Phase 2: 1-2 days
- Phase 3: 1 day

## Cost
- **Free**: Supabase free tier, Vercel free hosting
- **Total**: $0/month
