# Note App - Project Plan

## Overview
A web-based note-taking application similar to Evernote that works on iPhone and can be saved to the home screen as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

## Core Requirements
✅ Works on iPhone (mobile-first design)
✅ Can be saved to home screen (PWA - Progressive Web App)
✅ Rich text editing (bold, italic, underline)
✅ Add pictures from phone
✅ Cloud backup/sync
✅ Dark mode (based on your screenshots)
✅ Free to use (no app store fees)

## Technology Stack Options

### Option 1: Modern Web Stack (Recommended)
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework) - great for PWAs
- **Backend**: Supabase (free tier) or Firebase (free tier)
  - Handles: user authentication, database, file storage
- **Rich Text Editor**: TipTap or Slate.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for modern, responsive design)
- **PWA**: Built into Next.js

**Pros**: Modern, scalable, free backend options
**Cons**: Requires some setup

### Option 2: Simpler Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Backend**: Firebase (simpler setup)
- **Rich Text Editor**: React Quill
- **Styling**: CSS or Tailwind

**Pros**: Simpler, faster to get started
**Cons**: Less optimized for production

### Option 3: Full-Stack Framework
- **Framework**: Next.js with API routes
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (free tier)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (for images)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth

**Pros**: All-in-one, very modern
**Cons**: More complex initially

## Recommended: Option 1 (Next.js + Supabase)

### Why?
- ✅ Free tier is generous (500MB database, 1GB storage)
- ✅ Easy authentication
- ✅ Real-time sync possible
- ✅ Great mobile support
- ✅ PWA support built-in

```

## Setup Steps
1. Initialize Next.js project
2. Set up Supabase account and project
3. Configure authentication
4. Set up database schema (notes table)
5. Create basic UI components
6. Implement rich text editor
7. Add image upload functionality
8. Configure PWA manifest
9. Deploy to Vercel (free) or Netlify (free)

## Questions for You:
1. **Backend choice**: Do you want to use Supabase (free, easy) or would you prefer another option?
2. **Deployment**: Where should we host it? (Vercel is free and works great with Next.js)
3. **Features priority**: Which features are most important to you first?
4. **Design**: Should we match the dark theme from your screenshots exactly?

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 days of development
- Phase 2: 1-2 days
- Phase 3: 1 day

## Cost
- **Free**: Supabase free tier, Vercel free hosting
- **Total**: $0/month

## Multiple Projects Consideration

**Important**: Supabase free tier allows only **2 active projects** per account.

Since you want to make multiple similar apps, here are your options:

### Option A: Use One Supabase Project for All Apps (Recommended)
- **Single Supabase project** with separate tables/schemas for each app
- Each app connects to the same Supabase instance but uses different tables
- **Cost**: $0/month (one free project handles all apps)
- **Pros**: Completely free, easy to manage
- **Cons**: All apps share the same database (but data is separated by tables)

### Option B: Mix Free Backends
- Use **Supabase** for 2 apps (free tier)
- Use **Firebase** for additional apps (free tier: unlimited projects, generous limits)
- **Cost**: $0/month
- **Pros**: Each app has its own backend
- **Cons**: Need to learn two different systems

### Option C: Firebase for All Apps
- **Firebase free tier**: Unlimited projects
- **Cost**: $0/month (free tier is very generous)
- **Pros**: One system, unlimited projects, easy to use
- **Cons**: Slightly different setup than Supabase

### Option D: Self-Hosted Backend
- Use **PocketBase** (self-hosted, free, unlimited projects)
- Or **Supabase self-hosted** (more complex)
- **Cost**: $0/month (but requires your own server/VPS)
- **Pros**: Complete control, unlimited projects
- **Cons**: Need to manage server yourself

## Recommendation for Multiple Apps

**Best Option**: **Option A** (One Supabase project) or **Option C** (Firebase for all)

- If you want simplicity: Use **Firebase** for all apps (unlimited free projects)
- If you prefer Supabase: Use **one Supabase project** with separate tables per app

Both are completely free and work great for PWAs!

**Next Steps**: Review this plan and let me know:
1. **Backend choice**: Supabase (1 project for all apps) or Firebase (unlimited projects)?
2. **Deployment**: Where should we host it? (Vercel is free and works great with Next.js)
3. **Features priority**: Which features are most important to you first?
4. **Design**: Should we match the dark theme from your screenshots exactly?

Then I'll start building! 🚀
