## Setup Steps
1. Initialize Next.js project
2. Set up Firebase account and project
3. Configure Firebase Authentication
4. Set up Firestore database (notes collection)
5. Configure Firebase Storage (for images)
6. Create basic UI components
7. Implement rich text editor
8. Add image upload functionality
9. Configure PWA manifest
10. Deploy to Vercel (free) or Netlify (free)

## Questions for You:
1. **Backend choice**: Do you want to use Supabase (free, easy) or would you prefer another option?
2. **Deployment**: Where should we host it? (Vercel is free and works great with Next.js)
3. **Features priority**: Which features are most important to you first?
4. **Design**: Should we match the dark theme from your screenshots exactly?

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 days of development
- Phase 2: 1-2 days
- Phase 3: 1 day

## Cost
- **Free**: Firebase free tier (unlimited projects), Vercel free hosting
- **Total**: $0/month for all 6 apps!

## Multiple Projects Strategy

**Decision: Firebase for All Apps** ✅

Since you're making **6 different apps** (notes, scheduling, nutrition, exercise, etc.) and they're all **personal use only**:

- **Firebase**: Unlimited free projects (one per app)
- **Cost**: $0/month (free tier is perfect for personal use)
- **Each app gets its own Firebase project** - clean separation
- **Free tier limits** (per project):
  - 1GB storage
  - 50K reads/day
  - 20K writes/day
  - 20K deletes/day
  - More than enough for personal apps!

**Why Firebase wins:**
- ✅ Unlimited projects (vs Supabase's 2)
- ✅ Each app is completely separate
- ✅ Easy to set up and manage
- ✅ Great for PWAs
- ✅ Free tier is generous for personal use

**Next Steps**: 
1. ✅ **Backend**: Firebase (unlimited projects - perfect for your 6 apps!)
2. **Deployment**: Vercel (free, works great with Next.js)
3. **Features priority**: Let me know what's most important first
4. **Design**: Match the dark theme from your screenshots
